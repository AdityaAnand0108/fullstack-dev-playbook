# Practical 4-Month Roadmap

**Goal:** Become industry-ready as a React + Java full-stack developer with production-grade projects.

## Overview
This repo contains:
- Month-by-month & week-by-week roadmap
- Starter scaffolds for frontend (Vite + React) and backend (Spring Boot)
- Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions) examples
- Exercises, tests, and demo scripts

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

> **Learn by building. Refine by refactoring.**
>
> - Every week → one feature or project  
> - Every project → integrated with real APIs  
> - Every step → committed with clear documentation
