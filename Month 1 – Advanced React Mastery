# 🧠 Month 1 – Advanced React + JavaScript Mastery  

> 🎯 **Goal:** Deep dive into React internals, hooks, performance optimization, and architecture — while mastering modern JavaScript fundamentals used behind React.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository documents my **Month 1 Full Stack Developer Learning Journey**,  
focused on **Advanced React** concepts and **JavaScript mastery**.

- ⚛️ Advanced React (Hooks, State Management, React Query)
- 💛 JavaScript Core (Closures, Async, Performance)
- 🧩 Weekly mini-projects to solidify learning
- 🧠 Focus on performance, testing, and clean architecture

## 🗓️ Weekly Breakdown

### 📅 **Week 1: Advanced Hooks + JS Internals**
**React Topics:**
- `useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useRef`, `useImperativeHandle`

**JavaScript Topics:**
- Closures, Scope Chain, Hoisting, Execution Context

**Mini Project:**
> 🎓 Student Filter Dashboard  
Uses `useReducer` for state transitions and `useRef` for modal handling.

---

### 📅 **Week 2: Context API vs Redux Toolkit + Advanced JS**
**React Topics:**
- Context API  
- Redux Toolkit (`createSlice`, `configureStore`, `useDispatch`, `useSelector`)  
- Context vs Redux comparison

**JavaScript Topics:**
- Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`), Destructuring, Spread/Rest  
- Map, Set, Optional Chaining

**Mini Project:**
> 📘 Course Enrollment Dashboard  
Implemented in both Context API and Redux Toolkit.

---

### 📅 **Week 3: React Query + Async JS**
**React Topics:**
- React Query (TanStack)  
- Query & Mutation Hooks  
- Optimistic UI Updates  
- Caching, Refetching, and Pagination

**JavaScript Topics:**
- Promises, async/await  
- Fetch API, API chaining, error handling  

**Mini Project:**
> 🔄 Student Management App  
React Query + Mock API with optimistic updates.

---

### 📅 **Week 4: Performance + Testing + Advanced JS**
**React Topics:**
- Lazy Loading + Code Splitting (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`)
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Component Testing, Mock APIs

**JavaScript Topics:**
- Event Loop, Debouncing, Throttling  
- Modules (import/export), Memory Optimization  

**Mini Project:**
> ⚡ Student Admin Panel  
Lazy-loaded routes + tested components with Jest + RTL.
